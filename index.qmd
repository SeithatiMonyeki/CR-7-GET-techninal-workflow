South Africa is a special country, with diverse cultures, remarkable geological wealth and exceptional biodiversity, much of which is unique to our nation. With this rich endowment comes the responsibility and challenge of ensuring our species and ecosystems are conserved and used sustainably to the benefit of all South Africans and future generations. This biodiversity wealth gives our people tangible benefits like food, clean water, medicine and materials; it supports agricultural and fisheries production, and helps protect us from natural hazards like floods and droughts; and it provides the basis of a vibrant tourism industry while offering natural spaces for recreational and cultural activities.

:::

Biodiversity is central to South Africa's national objectives of addressing poverty, inequality and unemployment, and supports increased economic growth and improved service delivery for all its citizens. Examining biodiversity in the context of social and economic change shows us that investing in ecological infrastructure is as important as investing in built infrastructure, and safeguarding the delivery of services from ecosystems can support service delivery from all spheres of government.


The large number of terrestrial sites that qualify as global KBAs demonstrates the megadiverse wealth of South Africa. Of the approximately 357,198 km² that are confirmed South African Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA) sites, approximately 28% fall within formal protection. This demonstrates the potential of KBAs in the conservation framework, as KBAs that lack formal protection are positioned to be considered in protected area expansion strategies to ensure that South Africa’s protected areas footprint includes the most threatened species and ecosystems.
